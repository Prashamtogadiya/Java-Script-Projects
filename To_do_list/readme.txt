ðŸš€ **Excited to Share My Latest Project!** ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase a to-do list application Iâ€™ve recently developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This project includes:

- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and edit tasks with ease.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Prevents the addition of duplicate tasks.
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark tasks as completed with a simple checkbox.

This project not only highlights my skills in front-end development but also demonstrates my commitment to creating functional and user-friendly applications. 

Feel free to check out the code on [GitHub](#) and let me know what you think! ðŸ’¬
