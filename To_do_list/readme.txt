ðŸš€ **Excited to Present My Latest Project!** ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to share a to-do list application Iâ€™ve built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This project is packed with features that enhance task management and user experience:

- **Task Management**: Effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find tasks with a dynamic search feature.
- **Theme Toggle**: Seamlessly switch between dark and light modes for better accessibility.
- **Completion Tracking**: Monitor progress with real-time task completion updates.
